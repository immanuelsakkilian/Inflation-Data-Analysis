# Inflation-Prediction-in-India-with-Machine-Learning-
A study to find out the correlation inflation and CPI(Consumer Price Index).We have implemented various machine learning algorithms to find out pattern of rate of inflation over the time.Finally by using Karl Pearsons coefficient we have been successful in finding out top 5 factors which has affected inflation.
